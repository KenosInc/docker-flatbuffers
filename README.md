# docker-flatbuffers - Docker tooling for Flatbuffers

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/neomantra/docker-flatbuffers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/neomantra/docker-flatbuffers)  [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/neomantra/flatbuffers.svg)](https://microbadger.com/#/images/neomantra/flatbuffers "microbadger.com")

`docker-flatbuffers` is [Docker](https://www.docker.com) tooling for [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).  It also include C-language support using [`flatcc`](https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc).

Rather than building your own FlatBuffers installation, you can run `flatc` or `flatcc` in a container and ["bind mount"](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) your input and output directories (see [Usage As a Build Tool](#usage-as-a-build-tool)):

```
docker run -v /proj/src:/src -v /proj/dest:/dest neomantra/flatbuffers flatc --cpp --js --ruby -o /dest /src/monster.fbs
```


Supported Tags
==============

Images are availble in both `gcc` and `clang` variants, representing which toolchain was FlatBuffers was built from.  The plain, undecorated tag name uses `gcc`.   "master" branches are tagged with YYYYMMDD of the image build dates.  

Specific FlatBuffers/`flatc` and `flatcc` releases are tagged with their version name.  The `flatc` version isÂ prefixed with `v` and the `flatcc` version is prefixed with `cc`.

- `gcc`, `latest`
- `clang`
- `gcc-v1.8.0`, `v1.8.0`
- `clang-v1.8.0`
- `gcc-v1.8.0-cc0.5.1`

The builds are managed by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/neomantra/docker-openresty).

For best stability, pin your images to the full tag, for example `neomantra/flatbuffers:gcc-v1.8.0-cc0.5.1`.

Usage As An Image Build Stage
=============================

You can `COPY` from this image into your own images using the following Dockerfile stanzas.  Select the image, tag, and artifacts most appropriate for your project.   The included files are listed in the [Files In This Image](#files-in-this-image) section.

```
COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/bin/flatc /usr/local/bin/flatc
COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/include/flatbuffers /usr/local/include/flatbuffers
COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/lib/libflatbuffers.a /usr/local/lib/libflatbuffers.a
COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/lib/cmake/flatbuffers /usr/local/lib/cmake/flatbuffers


COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/bin/flatcc /usr/local/bin/flatcc
COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/include/flatcc /usr/local/include/flatcc
COPY --from=neomantra/flatbuffers /usr/local/lib/libflatcc.a /usr/local/lib/libflatccrt.a /usr/local/lib/
```


Usage As A Build Tool
=====================

You can generate files on the host through volume bind mounts.  The idea is that you mount a source directory into the container, invoke `flatc` on a schema in it, and write the output to a mounted destination.

Example:

```
# Input on host is in /my/src.
# Output written to /my/dest.
docker run -v /my/src:/src -v /my/dest:/dest neomantra/flatbuffers flatc --cpp --scoped-enums -o /dest /src/monster.fbs
```

Customizing The Docker Image Build
===================================

The Docker image build can be customized using the following build arguments.  They are activated by applying `--build-arg <arg>=<value>` to your `docker build` run.


| Arg | Default | Description |
:----- | :-----: |:----------- |
|FLATBUFFERS_IMAGE_BASE | debian | Docker image to use as a base image |
|FLATBUFFERS_IMAGE_TAG | stretch-slim | Docker image tag to use as a base image |
|FLATBUFFERS_ARCHIVE_BASE_URL | https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/archive | URL to download the flatbuffers archive from |
|FLATBUFFERS_ARCHIVE_TAG | master | FlatBuffers tag to download |
|FLATBUFFERS_BUILD_TYPE | Release | CMake build type (e.g. Release, Debug) |
|FLATBUFFERS_USE_CLANG | false | Set to exactly `"true"` to build with `clang` instead of `gcc` |
|FLATCC_ARCHIVE_BASE_URL | https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc/archive/ | URL to download the flatcc archive from |
|FLATCC_ARCHIVE_TAG | master | flatcc tag to download |
